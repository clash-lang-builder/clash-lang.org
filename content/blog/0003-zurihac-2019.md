# Clash tutorial
We'll be running a small tutorial where you will learn the basics of Clash, and hardware design, by building a stack-based CPU (think Forth).
Hopefully (see the next point for why) by the end of the weekend we will get to configure an actual FPGA with your designs.

# MiniZed project setup
We will have (at least) one [MiniZed](http://zedboard.org/product/minized) FPGA development kit with us.
This is a fairly feature-complete kit: Xilinx Zync ARMv7 CPU + FPGA System-on-Chip, 512 MB DRAM, 8GB Flash, WiFi+BlueTooth, Arduino-shield and 2 PMOD headers; and also relatively inexpensive ($89).
We hope to have it mostly setup before ZuriHac for easy Clash deployment, but could probably do with some help with further automation.
This will then serve as a basis for other Clash Board Support Packages (BSPs).
